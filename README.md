## Project History
On July 6, 2020, the Small Business Administration (SBA) released first round loan data from the Paycheck Protection Program (PPP). This project maps the spatial distribution of all these loan recipients, over an Esri-owned layer of US Average Income 2020. The team that worked on this project is a part of the IDA B. WELLS Just Data Lab, run by Professor Ruha Benjamin of Princeton University.
